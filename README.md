# To Do List

## Description 
This project displays a web page containing a to do list. This project demonstrates the ability to use React to build dynamic JS apps. This project uses programmatic styling to build and render a to-do list application. 

## How to Run 
Download all of the files. You will also need to make use of your own localhost server; tested on Chrome Version 91.0.4472.114. 

## Future Improvements 
Future improvements might include the ability to store and access archived to-do list items, a 'due-by' feature, and reminders/notifications.
